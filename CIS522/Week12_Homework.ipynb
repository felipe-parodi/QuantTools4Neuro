The goal of the actor network is to predict the action that maximizes the Q-value given the current state. This effectively amortizes the argmax search into training. Concretely, let $\\mu_{\\theta}$ be an actor network paramterized by $\\theta$. The actor's objective is to output an action that maximizes its Q-value:\n",

With continuous action spaces we can't do that, so we now turn to a neural network to learn this policy by mapping states to actions. Here we use a multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers of 256 neurons each with ReLU activations for the hidden layers and tanh for the final layer. This assumes an action space bounded in [-1,1]. In case we do differ from that, we keep track of the true max value and scale the result accordingly.

We will use the same tricks from the DQN models with regard to experience replay and target networks. Implementations to enable both of these are provided. We will also follow a similar pattern as in the tutorials where the DDPGAgent class will implement the act and train methods which are used to interact with the povided `learn_env` method. Given the added complexity needing to update two networks, we have broken those parts out into an `update` method which is where you will implement the actor and critic training steps.\n",

Since we can't do that here, we will instead add a small amount of noise to the continous action value. You can see this in the `act` method.\n",

An inverted pendulum starts in a random position and we must apply a real-valued force to get the pendulum to remain upright. The task ends after 200 steps with the reward at each step based on the current position, change in position, and force applied. This works out well as a test case for DDPG as there are only three elements in the state space and just a single element in the action space which makes this relatively fast to run and also achieve good results.\n",

The adoption of standards is one approach that has been largely discussed in the U.S. and globally to deal with these implications and give AI developers and users some guidelines. \n",

Standardizing how we process, leverage, and provide our training data is hugely important for study reproducibility and AI transparency. By maintaining high Data standards, such as by democratizing \\u201Ctools for capturing and representing knowledge and reasoning in AI systems\\u201D (e.g., DeepLabCut), not only do we build in consistency and robustness into our algorithms, but we also increase accessibility to the general public, which may have positive downstream effects on AI trustworthiness.
